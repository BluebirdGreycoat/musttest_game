[2017/11/27] Added chainsaw and charging machine.
[2017/11/26] Gas is now highly flammable. Careful with those torches!

[2017/11/19] Increased firetree fruit protection time from 3 to 6 seconds per fruit. Note that eating multiple fruit will stack the time.

[2017/9/24] Fixed various uninteresting bugs.
[2017/9/23] Put 3D armor strength back to 0.5, where it used to be. Full strength armor caused mobs to be unable to damage players, and rebalancing that is too difficult to be worth the trouble.
[2017/9/22] Fixed another bug in the market formspec.
[2017/9/22] Restored 3D armor to 'default' strength (1.0, instead of 0.5) because players were finding it too weak to be worth it.
[2017/9/22] Fixed annoying bug in the market formspec that caused players to get stuck unable to close the formspec if they had an older client.

[2017/9/17] Renamed bronze tools to copper tools, and adjusted tool recipes accordingly. Bronze tools were too hard to make and did not give enough value.

[2017/9/14] Picking bones now gives the picking player the XP stored in bones.

[2017/9/14] Reformatted infotext for deadplayer bones; added time of death, etc.

[2017/8/30] Fixed mesefuel bug. Mesefuel is no longer insanely overpowered.
