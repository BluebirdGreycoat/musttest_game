This is a very difficult game based on the PvP/PvE survival concept. However, it is not wholly survival themed.

History has it that long ago, colonists from another place landed in this inhospitable world and built the first city. With a foothold on this world now firmly established, trenchant pioneers are spreading out to claim land and even some bit of independence from the old colonial government. Can you tame the wild? Or will a future adventurer find your bones in a frozen, long-abandoned structure, in the midst of a vast white wilderness?

From the server's home page:

> The theme of this server is development and exploration. Exploration is very important for newcomers, and remains of value even to veteran players. This is how you find flowers and saplings at first, and later itâ€™s how you find new ore deposits. You can make stone tools before you get your first tree by hunting for dry shrubs, which can be crafted into sticks, and by using your first pick to dig a few cobble. Watch out for the mobs! It is usually best to farm or explore during the day and mine at night, in order to avoid them. Be sure to check the craft-guide which is part of your inventory. Veteran players who have built their way up to better technology & tools will find that survival becomes easier and leads to better building.

This game is designed to be run on a public, multiplayer server. It is NOT designed for singleplayer. This is not to say that it will never be useable in a singleplayer world, if people decide they want to put the work into making it happen.
