Note on the above:
Quote from OGA FAQ:

"Some artists have multiple licenses listed. Does that mean you need apply the
rules of all licenses or can we pick the one license we prefer?

You must follow only one of the licenses. However, when you re-distribute/edit,
you are encouraged to include/use all of the licenses, so the license spectrum
(and thus sum of people/projects who can use the art) doesn't shrink."
